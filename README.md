### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ In my spare time Iâ€™m working on <a href="https://github.com/KristianMarshall/EnvelopeBudget"> a webapp</a> to help utilize the envelope budgeting method virtually. As well as I'm working through <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2022/about">Advent of Code</a>
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning many languages in school such as C#, MySql, C++, Java, and Javascript. However, I'm most interested in learning new JS frameworks.
